Hey👋,

I am a researcher in security engineering with a focus on automated formal verification and the security of cryptographic schemes and implementations.
In the past, I've developed new proof techniques, built verification tools for low-level implementations, and improved countermeasures against strong physical adversaries combining passive side-channel and active fault attacks.

My research advances the view of formal verification as an active design tool that augments development processes by providing constructive feedback, thereby fostering more secure **and** more efficient software, rather than treating verification as a gatekeeper that filters generated code.
I want formal verification to become the analytical counterpart to ML that ensures generated code is correct, secure, and dependable.

Currently, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy](https://www.mpi-sp.org/) in the Foundations group led by Gilles Barthe.
Previously, I was a Senior Security and Verification Architect and [PI-level project lead](https://www.elektronikforschung.de/projekte/ve-jupiter) at NXP Semiconductors.
I obtained my PhD, awarded summa cum laude, from [Hamburg University of Technology](https://www.tuhh.de).
